# Sample setup for running functional testing

## Technologies used

* Cucumber-JVM
* Selenium
* Selenium-Grid
* Maven
* PhantomJS

Based on the book https://www.gitbook.com/book/sukesh15/cucumber-jvm-test-framework-/details but with a slightly change
so parallel execution can be performed

## Preconditions
You need to have PhantomJS, Firefox or Chrome previously installed if you would like to execute using one of those browsers.


## Usage

When executing maven you need to specify the environment you would like to execute this (usually qa, prod, smoke, etc)
and the viewport to use (mobile, desktop, tablet) by using -Denvironment=environmentName and -Dviewport=viewportName
that translates to a property filename where all the properties for execution are located. These are:

* environment -> the environment scripts will run (hostname)
* browser -> browser to use (firefox, chrome, phantomjs, more if you add the proper configs)
* window.width -> width the window
* window.height -> height of the window
* user.agent -> user agent to be used when executing the tests, this only applies to PhantomJS execution.
* selenium.grid.hub.url -> url where the grid is so execution is performed there


### Local Execution
For local execution you need to have all browsers needed for execution installed locally

### Remote Execution
As part of the maven command append -Dremote.execution=true and the execution will be done via GRID HUB
